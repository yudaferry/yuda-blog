- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety throughout the codebase
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with dark mode support
- **Vercel Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline active
- **Environment**: Development workflow with Turbopack

## Current Phase: Performance & Polish

**Priority Focus**: Optimizing for production readiness

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 2)
1. **Bundle Size Optimization** - Setup webpack bundle analyzer
2. **Error Boundaries** - Implement global error handling
3. **SEO Enhancement** - Dynamic meta tags and structured data
4. **Image Optimization** - Configure external image domains
5. **Lighthouse Score** - Target >95 performance score

## Next Session Plan/PRD

### Session Goals
1. **Performance Audit & Optimization**
   - Setup and run bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies
   - Implement code splitting where beneficial
   - Optimize bundle size to stay under 200KB target
   - Configure Next.js image domains for external images

2. **Error Handling & Resilience** 
   - Create global error boundary component
   - Add error pages for 404, 500, and other scenarios
   - Implement proper error logging and fallback states
   - Test error scenarios with Notion API failures

3. **SEO & Meta Enhancement**
   - Create dynamic meta tag generation for blog posts
   - Implement structured data for blog articles
   - Generate sitemap.xml automatically
   - Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags

4. **Production Readiness Review**
   - Run Lighthouse audit and address performance issues
   - Verify all environment variables are configured
   - Test deployment pipeline and preview environments
   - Document any remaining configuration needs

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- ✅ Bundle size analyzed and optimized (< 200KB)
- ✅ Error boundaries implemented and tested
- ✅ SEO meta tags working for all pages
- ✅ Lighthouse score > 90 (targeting > 95)
- ✅ All critical production issues resolved
